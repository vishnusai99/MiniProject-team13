# MiniProject-team13
This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for sequential recommendation. It covers data preprocessing, graph construction, and model training, followed by evaluation using metrics like HR@10 and NDGC@10. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the workflow for developing and testing a GNN-based recommendation system.
